# WakeWISEControllers
This repository contains all agents (networks, controllers) trained using the [WakeWISE](https://github.com/bdvanberkel/WakeWISE) wind farm wake steering simulation environment. Provided is the architecture of the agents, as well as some model files of the trained agents themselves. Different objective functions were used during training: power optimisation only (Greedy, AKA Naive), maintenance cost minimisation (Risk-averse) and combined optimisation (Informed). The informed policy maximises total net wind farm revenue by considering all aspects involved, e.g. maintenance cost as well as energy production maximisation. Furthermore, some agents trained on the larger Lillgrund and Horns Rev farms are also included, as well as agents trained with random layouts during training. An example script of usage for inference is also provided in this repository.
